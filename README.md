## Group Project: Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

### Planning

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

### Deliverable

Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

#### Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team? JSCH

  - Justin - initiator, persistence, relatively good understanding of JavaScript, creative in all aspects of life
  - Sarah - pretty good with react + Bootstrap, problem-solving & debugging, design (UX/UI)
  - Christopher - persistence, feel good about React, design (TailwindCSS), debugging
  - Haustin - debugging, logic (React/JavaScript/JSX), relatively mediocre at CSS, planning

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

  - We have a wide range of technical abilites, front-end and back-end, utilizing individual strengths to cover the full-spectrum of what is needed for project completion. Communicate with team members throughout project time and be flexible to help when and where needed.

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

  - Justin - incremental delivery, organization, refining technical skills
  - Sarah - planning and estimating, refining technical skills
  - Christopher - refining technical skills, time management
  - Haustin - refining technical skills, industry knowledge (best practices, jargon, libraries)

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

  - morning stand up to prepare day (structure, tasks to be worked on, groupwork when necessary), pair programming, work in groups to complete tasks and grow technical skills, divide and conquer issues/bugs (share responsibility), end of day huddle to review worked on code, critique, ACP.

#### Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

  - We foster an open, receptive working environment where any issue is heard and discussed with a team-focused approach. As early as possible, we gather the team and talk it out together. The team will collectively determine a way forward.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

  - Have a "solve it at the lowest level" attitude. As early as possible, the group will have a transparent conversation about the roles and responsbilities of each member in the project and focus the conversation on group-centric outcomes.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

  - Utilize daily huddle and implement "pair programming" opportunities for growth in areas where individuals and we as a group may fall short. In group huddle, share our individual work and contributions so that everyone is up to speed. Again, we foster and promote questions so that we are always learning and have a transparent environment.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

  - Respectfully, with the goal of holding each other to transparent expectations. First, the group will discuss the "why?". Determine, as a group, a plan of approach to alleviate problems/concerns and provide support as needed.

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

  - A certain threshold must be hit. The threshold here invovles a willful action to not participate, sabotage, hurt the project, or another member of the team. When that threshold is hit, we will involve our Codefellows cohort leadership.

#### Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

- What hours will you be available to communicate?

  - 9AM-6PM+. As needed to be able to complete project in a timely manner. We only have a short window of opportunity to work on project.

- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

  - Slack, Remo, Discord

- How often will you take breaks?

  - Lunchtime, as needed.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

  - Take a step back, re-evaluate our project direction and consider restructuring or scalign back if project proves to be too substantial for our timeframe.

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

  - Firstly, Slack. Secondly, cell phone.

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

  - Dedicated time to speak during daily stand-up/huddles. Encourage communication and allow for conversation flow throughout the day and week via Slack/Discord/Remo.

- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

  - Encouraging all team members to ask questions when needed and genuinely answering each others questions. Understanding that we're all here to learn and succeed.

#### Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

Describe at least:

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

  - We are going to use Trello for our project tasks and we will have daily morning stand-up meetings for potentially more specific tasks/concerns. As the project evolves and more specific tasks are needed, we can identify them and assign them in our Trello cards. Commuincate with team via Slack, morning stand-up meetings, and end of day huddles.

#### Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?

  - Our frontend React apps and backend servers. Only aspects of project not living on GitHub will be our .env files and node module directories. We have established an organization on GitHub and will create a "staging" branch that will be the default branch for everyone's individuals commits. At least three members (ideally all four) will huddle up for 10 minutes at the end of day to confirm merge readiness and merge.

- What is your Git flow?

  - During morning stand-up, confirm everyone has pulled from main.
  - Ensure everyone is tracking their task/file that they will be working on.
  - Create the daily branch using naming convention: [first name]-[file worked on]-[specific feature (if applicable)].
  - Frequent commits, one end-of-day push.
  - End-of-day sync/push to main, and merge to main.
  - Each member then pulls from main to their local repo for next days' work.

### Submitting Your Work

This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit.

Please have everyone’s name at the top of the doc.

Submit a link to the GitHub markdown file where you have created your Team Agreement.

This step must be completed and approved before proceeding with any project work. Notify your instructor when this is ready for review.
